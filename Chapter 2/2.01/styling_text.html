        <p>Edgar Allen Poe</p>
        <p class="poem">
            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
            “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.”       
        </p>
